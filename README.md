Hello and Welcome to the clearwinggames Github (which is very much a work in progress, much like clearwinggames itself)

To see a few playable demos of games built using CWG infrastructure, check out

[The GHTML Wiki](../../../GHTML/wiki)

which has at least a couple of links to game builds.

Most of the repositories (80%) are private and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future, however, more and more public stuff should be being published as time goes on.
